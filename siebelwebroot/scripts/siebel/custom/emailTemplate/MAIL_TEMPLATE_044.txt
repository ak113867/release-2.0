Hi <input class="InlineField" SEQ="1" type='text'/>,
<br><br>
We noticed you?re still using our Instant Connect service which is only available for a limited time. Now that your Vodafone nbn is active and ready to use, we want you to make the most of it. 
<br><br>
To turn off Instant Connect and connect to nbn, you?ll need to check that your Vodafone Wi-Fi Hub is setup. To check if you're set up correctly, head to https://www.vodafone.com.au/nbntroubleshooting or call us on 1300 801 122 if you need help. 
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Your Vodafone team
<br><br>
