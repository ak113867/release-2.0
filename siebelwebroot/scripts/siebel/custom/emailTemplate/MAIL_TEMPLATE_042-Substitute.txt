Hi _1__,
<br><br>
We noticed you still haven't used your Vodafone nbn service yet. You won't be able to access your Instant Connect service anymore as this has now stopped because we can see that your nbn service is active as per our Instant Connect terms and conditions: https://www.vodafone.com.au/terms. Our team are here to help if you're having any issues. 
<br><br>
To check that your Vodafone Wi-Fi Hub is set up correctly, head to https://www.vodafone.com.au/nbntroubleshooting or give us a call on 1300 801 122. 
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Your Vodafone team
