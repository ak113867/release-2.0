Hi _1__,
<br><br>
We noticed you're still using our Instant Connect service even though your nbn service is active. We will stop the Instant Connect service in two days as per our Instant Connect terms and conditions: https://www.vodafone.com.au/terms. 
<br><br>
We want you to get the most out of Vodafone nbn. To turn off Instant Connect and connect to nbn, you'll need to check that your Vodafone Wi-Fi Hub is setup correctly. To check if you're set up correctly, head to https://www.vodafone.com.au/nbntroubleshooting or call us on 1300 801 122 if you need help.
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Your Vodafone team
