Hi _1__,
<br><br>
We noticed you recently used your built-in 4G SIM for when there's a fault on your nbn. We believe this fault is now resolved. Don't forget, this 4G Backup service is only available while the fault is ongoing so you'll now need to switch back to using Vodafone nbn.
<br><br>
To check that your Vodafone Wi-Fi Hub is set up correctly, head to https://www.vodafone.com.au/nbntroubleshooting or call us on 1300801122 if you need help. 
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Your Vodafone team
