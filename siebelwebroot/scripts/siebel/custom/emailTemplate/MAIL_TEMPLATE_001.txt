Hi,
<br><br>
When faced with domestic or family violence, we want to help you. 
<br><br>
We've included some important information to help you stay connected
You'll need to take the following documents to a Vodafone store:<br>
- Relevant identification, such as a driver's license or Medicare card<br>
- A Statutory Declaration witnessed by an authorised person that you are, or have been the subject of domestic or family violence. Visit www.vodafone.com.au/statdec to download the Statutory Declaration<br>
- In some cases we may also require you to support your request by supplying an AVO/police report/court order/ or a letter from women's shelter<br>
- The device associated to the mobile number you've been using
<br><br>
When in store, our team will verify these documents and we'll send a one-time passcode to the mobile number associated with the service to prove your relationship with that number.
<br><br>
For more information call 1300 650 410
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Your Vodafone Team
<br><br>
