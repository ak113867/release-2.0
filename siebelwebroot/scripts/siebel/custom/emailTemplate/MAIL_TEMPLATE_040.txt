Hi <input class="InlineField" SEQ="1" type='text'/>,
<br><br>
Your 4G Back-up service will be stopped tomorrow as the fault is now resolved and your nbn service should be working as per our 4G Backup terms and conditions: https://www.vodafone.com.au/terms. Our team are here to help if you're having any issues. 
<br><br>
So that you stay connected to nbn, please check that your Vodafone Wi-Fi Hub is set up correctly by heading to https://www.vodafone.com.au/nbntroubleshooting or call us on 1300801122. 
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Your Vodafone team
